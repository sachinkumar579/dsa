Class 

A way to group together data that belongs together along with methods that are designed to manipulate that data 

why do we even care about effeciency of programs

Because data sets are getting massive . Machines are expected to run programs faster 

A poorly written program can take really long to execute despite running on a faster machine 

This measurement of performance/efficiency is independent of machine the code runs on 

Check the behavior of the program as we change the size of the input 

Express efficiency in terms of size of input 

Express the growth of the programs runtime as that input grows 

In polynomial expressions its the highest order expression that captures the complexity
