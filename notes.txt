Algorithm -series of steps to solve a problem 

Data Structures 

Effeciency also called complexity is about how well we use Computer resources to get any job done

Thinking about efficiency in terms of Space and Time complexity 

Time complexity - how long does code take to run 
Space complexity - how much storage space it needs 

O(n) Big O notation - describing efficiencty of code 

(n) -> an algebraic expression - a mathematical function of variable n 

n - length of input to the function 

function print( input ){
  
   


}
